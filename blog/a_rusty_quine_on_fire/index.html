    <h1>A rusty quine on fire</h1>
    <p>
        I recently watched tsoding make a quine clock.
        I knew about quines before though never really knew how to write them, 
        I mean I never tried. In the video Tsoding shows a really cool language-agnostic
        way ho to approach writing a quine.
        He first shows that printing the source normally would not work, because the surrounding print statement would then still be missing from the quine. 
        Of course it is possible to do this by reading one's own source file from disk, then printing that.
        But that would only work if the source file can be found under the expected path.
